# Core Theory Snapshot

- **Maxwell (U(1))** emerges from the E⊥B geometry: F=dA, Bianchi dF=0.
- **Dirac** emerges from SU(2)×SU(2) half‑spin structure; minimal coupling consistent with U(1).
- **Yang–Mills** provides the non‑Abelian generalization with F^a and covariant derivative D_μ.
- **Gravity/PPN**: weak‑field ansatz coupled to an invariant I1=2(B^2−E^2); extract (γ,β).
- **Projection law** connects intrinsic vs observed across technique and scale.
- **Nuclear shells**: degeneracy sequence from chord counts with spin‑doubling; cumulative matches canonical magic numbers.
- **Fourier**: phase→13 mapping; subharmonics at 26.

All are testable here via code in `validations/`.
