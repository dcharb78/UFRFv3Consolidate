# Axioms (UFRF)

1. **Trinity concurrency** — three coupled field planes (E, B, B′) rotate concurrently in dual planes.
2. **13‑cycle phase space** — discrete positions (0..12) with **REST** at 10 (E≈B; impedance √φ).
3. **Geometric realization** — standing‑wave geometry (e.g., cuboctahedral/cartan projections) constrains allowed resonances.
4. **Scale coupling / Projection law** — observed vs intrinsic follows  
   \(\ln O = \ln O^* + d_M\,\alpha\,S + \varepsilon\), with \(d_M=\ln(M_{\rm obs}/M_{\rm tgt})\), technique coupling \(\alpha\), and signed sensitivity \(S\).
5. **Fourier operator** — orthogonal sine/cosine basis ↔ E/B; phase encodes position in the 13‑cycle.

**Glossary**: REST (E≈B), Cartan (U(1)^2 in SU(3)), half‑spin (SU(2)×SU(2) → 26 positions), 14‑Law (11–12–13 ↦ 1–2–3 hand‑off).
