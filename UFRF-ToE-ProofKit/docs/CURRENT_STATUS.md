# Current Status (Proof Map)

- **Maxwell** — green: Bianchi residual ≈ 0; action L=−¼F² included.
- **Dirac** — green: γ matrices, current j^μ, minimal coupling sanity.
- **Yang–Mills** — kinematics green (structure constants, non‑abelian F). REST abelianization trend observed in controlled scans.  
  Fingerprints at 13/26 need multi‑dimensional test (Cartan torus, SU(2) subgroups, 2D FFT/bispectrum, characters).
- **PPN** — extractor in place; match to Cassini/LLR bounds with the repo inputs (parameter window to be recorded).
- **Projection Law** — fitter ready; apply to technique‑split datasets (LoCuSS WL vs HSE, etc.).
- **Nuclear** — degeneracy & cumulative sequences recovered; simple regression tests provided.

**Gatekeeping**: if 13/26 fingerprints don’t appear in SU(3) after the multi‑dimensional battery, constrain the claim to abelian/near‑REST contexts.
