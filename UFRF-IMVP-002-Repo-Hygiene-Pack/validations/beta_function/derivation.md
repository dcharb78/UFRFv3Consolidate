# Derivation Notes

**Purpose.** Document the path from UFRF axioms to this validation’s equations and
the specific implementation choices made in code.

## Outline
1. Starting equations and assumptions
2. Mapping from geometry → observable
3. Projection terms (if any) and where they apply
4. Data inputs and preprocessing
5. Numerical method and tolerances
6. Expected outputs and acceptance ranges
7. How to reproduce figures and JSON artifacts
