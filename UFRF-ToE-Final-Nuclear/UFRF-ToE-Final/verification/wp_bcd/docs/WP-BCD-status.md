**What we just executed:**

1) **Variable‑coupling hyperbolicity** — With local Z(Φ), Θ(Φ), the principal symbol in Lorenz gauge is
   **Z(x)□A^ν**; gradients (∂Z, ∂Θ) enter only at lower order. Dispersion **ω^2=|k|^2** holds locally; hyperbolic for **Z>0**.

2) **Disformal emergent metric, linearized near REST** — For small coefficients *(|a|≤0.05, 0≤b≤0.02, 0≤c≤0.02)* and
   small backgrounds *(|E|=|B|≤0.2, |∂Φ|≤0.2)* with **E⊥B** & **E=B**, the metric **remains Lorentzian** and
   the photon cone along x is **≤ c** in a Monte‑Carlo scan (no superluminal cases).

3) **Yang–Mills stub (A^a_μ=0 background)** — Canonical analysis gives **ℋ = ½ Z Σ_a(E_a^2+B_a^2)** and
   **ω = ±|k|** for the principal modes; positivity and hyperbolicity extend to the non‑abelian case for **Z>0**.

All three are now part of the repo tests.
