# WP‑B Status Note (generated 2025-10-19 05:07:26)

This note summarizes three executed checks supporting **Lorentz/U(1) invariance, positivity, and causality**:

1. **Dirac local U(1) gauge invariance**
   - Demonstrated that **D_μ ψ → e^{-iqχ} D_μ ψ** under ψ→e^{-iqχ}ψ, A_μ→A_μ+∂_μχ.
   - Therefore **L_D = ψ̄ (iγ^μ D_μ − m) ψ** is invariant (spinor indices suppressed).

2. **EM Hamiltonian positivity with constant Z,Θ**
   - From **L = ½ Z (E²−B²) + Θ E·B**, the canonical momentum is Π = Z E + Θ B.
   - Legendre transform gives **ℋ = ½ Z (E² + B²)** (Θ cancels), hence positivity for **Z(Φ)>0**.

3. **Hyperbolicity (principal symbol; Lorenz gauge)**
   - For constant Z,Θ the principal part reduces to **Z □ A_μ**, yielding **ω² = |k|²** (lightlike).
   - Thus characteristic speeds ≤ c and equations are hyperbolic in the linearized regime.

These results are integrated with the UFRF axioms (REST, 13/26 cycle, projection law) in the main docs.
