# Action notes (WP‑A)

- We treat $g_{\mu\nu}$ as flat for the first variational pass and move $g_{\mu\nu}[F,\Phi]$ to WP‑D (emergent geometry).  
- A $\Phi$-dependent $\Theta$ term induces axion‑like electrodynamics; we will keep $\Theta'(\Phi)$ small in linearized checks.
- REST term $\mathcal{C}_{\text{REST}}$ is implemented as a soft constraint favoring $E^2=B^2$ and $\mathbf E\!\cdot\!\mathbf B\!\approx\!0$ near specific $\Phi$ phases.
- The $V_{13}$ potential encodes the 13/26 structure.
