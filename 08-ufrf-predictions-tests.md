- DNA not optimized near 10.5
- No enhancement in other systems

**Current status:** Multiple confirmations

#### Test 5: Projection Law
**Null Hypothesis:** Measurements independent of observer scale and technique

**Falsification criterion:**

**Current status:** Confirmed in cosmology and nuclear physics

## Part III: Experimental Protocols
### 1.x PPN Micro‑oscillations

Prediction: γ(t) and β(t) show small, coherent oscillations around 1 with frequencies set by the leading beat at the observation scale; cross‑technique offsets obey the projection law.

Test: conduct simultaneous multi‑technique campaigns with shared time base; report ⟨γ⟩, ⟨β⟩, spectral content, and technique (α) tags along with the averaging window Δt.

### Network/Observer Composition Test

Prediction: composing observer layers changes the apparent constant by the sum of composed d_M·α·S terms; verify with synthetic observers in simulation.

Test: simulate A observing B observing C; fit ln O_A and show ln O_A − ln O*_C ≈ d_M(A,B)·α_B·S_B + d_M(B,C)·α_C·S_C.

## Conclusion

UFRF makes specific, testable predictions derived from geometric first principles. The predictions are:

1. **Quantitative** - Specific numbers from geometry
2. **Falsifiable** - Clear criteria for disproof
3. **Novel** - Not known from existing theory
4. **Universal** - Apply across all scales
5. **Testable** - With current technology

The diversity of predictions, from nuclear physics to consciousness, all derived from the same geometric axioms, provides multiple independent tests. The framework has already shown remarkable validation in explaining existing data through the projection law. Future experimental tests of novel predictions will further validate or falsify the geometric framework.
