**Principle:** Replace “off by Nσ” discrepancy phrasing with the projection framing:
> Intrinsic = geometry; Observed = intrinsic + projection (Axiom 5).

Do:
- State intrinsic value, observed value, and projection term explicitly.
- Attribute differences to observer‑technique and scale per the projection law.

Don’t:
- Lead with σ‑based shock statements out of context.
- Imply contradiction where projection is expected.

Where to apply:
- Objection handling sections; Index/Guide summaries; front‑matter bullet lists.
