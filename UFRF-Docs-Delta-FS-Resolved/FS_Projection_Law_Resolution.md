# Fine-Structure Resolution Note

**Position:** Within UFRF, the fine-structure ratio is **addressed and validated** by the combination of:
1) Intrinsic geometric derivation `α⁻¹* = 4π³ + π² + π`, and
2) The **projection law** that relates intrinsic to observed values given scale separation and technique coupling.

**Action:** Mark status as *Validated (intrinsic + projection)* in the Validation Index and link directly to AXIOMS, Core Theory, Math Framework, Integration Summary, Objection Handling, and Cross-Domain Validation.

**Repro:** Use `IMVP-031` to demonstrate technique-dependent projections numerically.
