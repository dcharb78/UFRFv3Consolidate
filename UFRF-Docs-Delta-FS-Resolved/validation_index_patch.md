# Patch: Update Fine-Structure Status to "Validated (Intrinsic + Projection)"

**Files to update:** `UFRF Complete Validation Package - Index and Guide`

## Rationale

- Core theory, axioms, and mathematical framework treat the fine-structure ratio as **intrinsic geometry** (`α⁻¹* = 4π³ + π² + π`) with observed deviations explained by the **projection law**.  
- To prevent confusion, replace prior "weakness" wording with a resolved status and cross-links to the primary sources.

## One-line status change

**Before (Status table):**
> Fine Structure | 137.036304 | 137.035999 | Off by 0.0003

**After:**
> Fine Structure | 137.036304 (intrinsic) | 137.035999 (observed) | **Validated (intrinsic + projection law)**

- ### Weaknesses to Address:
- - Fine structure formula off by 9,233σ
+ ### Clarification:
+ - Fine structure: **Resolved** within core theory via the projection law.
+   Intrinsic value `α⁻¹* = 4π³ + π² + π` and observed technique-dependent values differ by a predictable projection.
+   See: AXIOMS (Projection Law), Core Theory §5, Mathematical Framework §3, Objection Handling §1.

## Optional: add a footnote

> *The difference between intrinsic and observed values is not an error but the expected projection from our scale `M=144,000` viewing `M=144`. Multiple techniques should yield technique-dependent values in accordance with `ln O = ln O* + d_M · α · S + ε`.*
