# AXIOMS Projection Footnote (α case)

Add under Axiom 5 (Projection Law) examples:

> **Example (α case).** For `M_obs/M_src = 1000` (human vs nuclear), the fitted
> projection for `α⁻¹` is `α·S ≈ −3.22×10⁻⁷`. This one term accounts for the
> observed minus intrinsic difference discussed elsewhere in the package.

This keeps the projection narrative consistent across domains and prevents
over‑interpreting technique‑dependent discrepancies.
