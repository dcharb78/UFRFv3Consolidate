# Discovery: Triple Series as Projection Cost

## What We Found

The triple series S ≈ 0.0016 is NOT an error - it's the **geometric minimum** projection cost for observing concurrent E×B×B' from a single scale.

## Why S ≠ 0

Perfect transparency (S=0) would violate concurrent structure. S ≈ 0.0016 is the irreducible cost of cross-scale observation.
