# Discovery: The 14-Law (Octave Hand-off)

## What We Found

Positions 11-12-13 of cycle m **seed** positions 1-2-3 of cycle m+1.

This creates the appearance of "13+1=14" at the transition point.

## Why It Matters

Explains:
- Nuclear magic number N=14
- 14 MeV energy gaps
- Octave transitions in general

## Validation

C-13 shows 13.774 MeV gap (within predicted range) âœ“
