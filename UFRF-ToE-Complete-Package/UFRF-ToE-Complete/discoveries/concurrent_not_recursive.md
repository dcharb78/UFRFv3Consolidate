# Discovery: Concurrent, Not Recursive

## What We Found

UFRF **appears** recursive (scales building up) but is actually **concurrent** (all scales simultaneous).

## Evidence

1. Projection law S â‰  0 requires concurrent interference
2. Beta function shows log-periodic ripple from all scales
3. Magic numbers require multiple octaves simultaneously

## Paradigm Shift

Changes how we think about:
- Causality (concurrent, not linear)
- Emergence (projection, not building)
- Observation (scale-dependent, not absolute)
