# Renormalization Group Flows from UFRF

## Beta Function

From concurrent trinity interference:

```
β₀ = 2/(3π) ≈ 0.2122
```

## Derivation

See `/validations/beta_function/beta_from_ufrf_concurrent.py`

Key insight: β₀ is the **projection coefficient** when observing concurrent pattern through log-phase space.

## RG Equation

```
μ dα/dμ = β(α)
```

is projection law in energy-scale form.

## Validation

Exact match to QED β₀ ✓
