## Trinity Octaves and Magic Numbers

Magic numbers emerge from trinity octave closures:

```
N=2:  T₀ closure
N=8:  T₁ closure  
N=14: T₁→T₂ hand-off (14-law)
N=20: Full cycle completion
N=28, 50, 82, 126: Higher octave closures
```

## Derivation

From trinity levels Tₘ = {-(m+0.5), 0, +(m+0.5)}:

Each level creates shell closure when:
1. Trinity completes rotation (13-cycle)
2. Hand-off to next octave (14-law)
3. REST-like configuration achieved
