# Quantum Mechanics from UFRF

## Schrödinger Equation Emergence

From v13 validation: Schrödinger equation emerges from UFRF at REST.

Ground state energy: 1.644 (dimensionless)
Gap to first excited: 4.93

## Derivation

Concurrent trinity interference creates:
```
iℏ ∂ψ/∂t = Ĥψ
```

where Ĥ emerges from E×B vortex energy.

## Wavefunction

ψ represents **projection** of concurrent states onto observation axis:
```
ψ(x,t) = ∫ Ψ_concurrent · W_M(x) dx
```

## Measurement

"Collapse" is **projection** via projection law:
```
Ψ_concurrent → ψ_observed (at scale M)
```

## Validation

v13 results match standard QM ✓
