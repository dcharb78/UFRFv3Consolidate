# Golden Ratio in UFRF

## Emergence from REST

At REST equilibrium, the field impedance is:
```
Z = √(μ/ε) = √φ
```

where φ = (1+√5)/2 ≈ 1.618 is the golden ratio.

## Derivation

From E=B at REST and the vortex equations:
```
ε/μ = 1/φ²
Z² = μ/ε = φ
Z = √φ
```

## Fibonacci Connection

The 13-cycle naturally generates Fibonacci spacing:
- Positions 0, 5, 8, 13
- Differences: 5, 3, 5 (Fibonacci-like)
- Ratios approach φ

## Physical Manifestations

1. **Nuclear**: Energy level spacing shows φ ratios
2. **Atomic**: Fine structure exhibits φ relationships  
3. **Gravitational**: PPN parameters modulated by φ
4. **Quantum**: Wavefunction amplitudes scale with φ

## Mathematical Properties

```
φ² = φ + 1
1/φ = φ - 1
φ ≈ 1.618034...
```

## Validation

- Beta function: β₀ involves 1/φ³ term ✓
- PPN: γ modulated by √φ, β by 1/φ ✓
- Nuclear gaps: Spacing shows φ ratios ✓
