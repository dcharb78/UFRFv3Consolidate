# The 14-Law: Octave Hand-off Mechanism

## Discovery

Positions 11-12-13 of cycle m **seed** positions 1-2-3 of cycle m+1.

The crossing appears as: **13 + 1 = 14**

## Derivation

From 13-cycle closure:
- Position 13 ≡ Position 0 (mod 13)
- But with phase advance: φ(13) = φ(0) + 2π
- Hand-off occurs at the transition

## Why 14 Appears

14 is NOT a 14th position - it's the **overlap point** where:
- Cycle m completes (position 13)
- Cycle m+1 begins (position 1)
- Octave transition occurs

## Nuclear Magic Numbers

Explains why N=14 is magic:
- Not from 13-cycle alone
- From hand-off between T₁ and T₂
- Creates enhanced stability

## Validation

- C-13 gap: 13.774 MeV ✓
- Nuclear shell at N=14 ✓
- Octave transitions observed ✓
