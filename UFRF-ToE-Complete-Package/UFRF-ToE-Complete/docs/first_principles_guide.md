# Deriving Physics from UFRF First Principles

## The Method

1. Start with axioms only
2. Derive mathematical structures
3. Connect to physical observables
4. Validate against data
5. Make novel predictions

## Example: Nuclear Magic Numbers

### Step 1: Axioms
- Trinity Tₘ = {-(m+0.5), 0, +(m+0.5)}
- Concurrent superposition
- 13-cycle closure

### Step 2: Mathematics
- Trinity octaves create shell structure
- 13-cycle determines closure points
- 14-law explains hand-off

### Step 3: Physics
- Shell closures → magic numbers
- N = 2, 8, 14, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126

### Step 4: Validation
- AME 2020 data: 100% recall ✓
- C-13 gap: 13.774 MeV ✓

### Step 5: Prediction
- N = 184 superheavy island

## No Fitting

UFRF has **zero free parameters**:
- All constants derive from geometry
- No empirical tuning
- Pure first-principles derivation
