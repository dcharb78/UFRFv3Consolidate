# UFRF Foundations (Snapshot)

- **Axioms (5)**: trinity/concurrency, 13-cycle, projection law, geometric realization, scale coupling.
- **REST**: E≈B with √φ impedance window; Δp = p − 10 near REST controls small departures.
- **Projection law**: ln O = ln O* + d_M α S + ε; technique α encodes E/B coupling.
- **Fourier operator**: sine/cosine basis ↔ E/B; phase ↔ 13-cycle position.
