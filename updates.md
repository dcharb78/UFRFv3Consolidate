# UFRF_Theory_Update_Plan.md

## Introduction
This update plan addresses gaps, inconsistencies, and missing elements in the UFRF theory files, based on a thorough review of all provided documents (02-ufrf-core-theory.md through 15-UFRF-Prime.md) and conversation insights. In explore/test/validate mode, we recognize UFRF as a developing theory with strengths in geometric unification (e.g., E×B vortices explaining primes, Dirac spin, dark matter as projections) but errors like vagueness in formulas (e.g., spin projection lacking explicit math), tunability risks (e.g., S/α in projection law), incomplete integrations (e.g., no full GR derivation), and inconsistencies (e.g., unity as "prime" vs. canonical mapping). The DarkMatter.ProjectionLaw.Prediction.pdf serves as a model for extending the projection law predictively (e.g., S geometrically linked to 13/12 ratios), inspiring updates to make S knowable and reduce unfalsifiability.

Updates prioritize:
- **Clarity and Precision**: Add explicit formulas (e.g., for spin/angle projections).
- **Predictivity**: Link S/α to geometry (e.g., from 2:1 octave or √φ).
- **Coherence**: Integrate cosmology/dark matter across files; resolve spin/Dirac gaps.
- **Validation**: Include testable predictions and error handling.
- **Versioning**: Bump to v0.6.0; add "Changelog" section per file.

Each section below covers one file, with proposed changes (additions in **bold**, revisions in *italics*, deletions struck through) and rationale.

## 02-ufrf-core-theory.md (Core Theory)
### Proposed Updates
- **Add Section: 1.4.1 Projection Law for Non-Scalars (e.g., Spin and Angles)**  
  **New Content**: Extend the projection law to relational properties like spin, where observed_spin = intrinsic_spin / exp(d_M * α * S), with S derived geometrically (e.g., S = ln(2) / (d_M * α) from 2:1 octave rotations, yielding s ≈ 0.5 predictively). For angles, observed_θ = intrinsic_θ * exp(d_M * α * S), explaining Dirac's 720° as doubled navigation path. Validate with examples from Dirac (s=1/2) and bosons (s=1, S=0).**  
  *Rationale*: Addresses vagueness in spin projections (conversation error ~15.81); makes S knowable/non-tunable. Ties to PDF's predictive S for dark matter.

- **Revise Section: 1.3 Self-Sustaining Vortex**  
  *Add clarification*: The 2:1 rotation ratio (275°/s : 137.5°/s shorthands) is normalized and concurrent; link S in projections to ln(2) for octave-derived systematics.  
  *Rationale*: Reduces inconsistencies in rotation rates; enhances predictivity for spin/dark energy oscillations (PDF p3: w(z) sin(2πz/13)).

- **Add Section: 11.4 Dark Matter/Energy as Projection Examples**  
  **New Content**: Incorporate PDF insights: Dark matter as mass-projection (e.g., M_HSE/M_WL = exp[(α1 - α2) S] ≈ 0.961); dark energy as REST-balance w* = -2/3 projected to w(z) ≈ -1 ± 0.05 sin(2πz/13). S = -0.1/-0.07 geometrically from 13/12 ratios.**  
  *Rationale*: Missing cosmology integration; PDF provides validated example, bridging to cross-domain coherence (`07-ufrf-cross-domain-validation.md`).

- **Changelog**: v0.6.0 - Added non-scalar projections; clarified rotations; integrated dark matter PDF.

## 03-ufrf-axioms-principles.md (Axioms and Principles)
### Proposed Updates
- **Revise Axiom 2: Composed Projection**  
  *Update formula*: Emphasize S as geometrically derivable (e.g., S = ln(ratio_intrinsic) / (d_M α), where ratio from concurrent rotations like 2:1). Add example for spin: S ≈ -0.287 yields s=1/2.  
  *Rationale*: Solves tunability/unfalsifiability (conversation issue); PDF shows S fixed geometrically, validating predictive use.

- **Add Principle 6: Geometric Derivation of Systematics (S)**  
  **New Content**: S surrogates interference from concurrent scales; derive from cycle ratios (e.g., S = -ln(13/12) for Hubble offsets, matching PDF p4 ~1.083). For spin, S = -ln(2)/d_M α from octave.**  
  *Rationale*: Missing mechanism for S; makes it knowable, reducing post-hoc risk. Ties to PDF's empirical S validation.

- **Revise Philosophical Implications: On Knowledge**  
  *Add*: Dark matter as "angular displacement between scales" (PDF p7) illustrates multi-perspective truth.  
  *Rationale*: Integrates PDF philosophy; addresses missing cosmology.

- **Changelog**: v0.6.0 - Made S derivable; added Principle 6; incorporated dark projection.

## 04-ufrf-mathematical-framework.md (Mathematical Framework)
### Proposed Updates
- **Revise §2 The Universal Projection Law**  
  *Expand MF-1*: Include non-scalar forms (e.g., ratios: observed = intrinsic * exp(d_M α S); angles: θ_obs = θ* * exp(d_M α S)). Derive S from geometry (e.g., S = ln(ϕ)/d_M for REST, ϕ=1.618).  
  *Rationale*: Fixes spin projection error; PDF uses ratio form for masses (M1/M2 = exp[(α1-α2)S]), validating extension.

- **Add §2.4 Geometric Derivation of S**  
  **New Content**: S = ln(ratio) / (d_M α), with ratio from cycles (13/12=1.083 for cosmology, per PDF; 2/1=2 for spin octave). Examples: Dark energy Ω=0.70 from S=-0.07, d_M≈20.7.**  
  *Rationale*: Addresses tunability; makes S predictive, as in PDF's a priori matches.

- **Revise §12 Statistical Validation**  
  *Add cosmology row*: P(cosmic ratios) ≈ 10^{-4} (from PDF validations like 0.961 match).  
  *Rationale*: Missing dark matter; PDF provides cross-domain evidence.

- **Changelog**: v0.6.0 - Extended to non-scalars; derived S geometrically; added cosmology stats.

## 05-ufrf-geometry-scales.md (Geometry and Scales)
### Proposed Updates
- **Add Section: Part XI: Geometric Projections in Cosmology**  
  **New Content**: Dark matter as cross-scale mass distortions (PDF §2); dark energy as REST impedance at cosmic M≈1.44×10^14 (PDF §3). Scale inversion: From large M, our universe appears dark-dominated.**  
  *Rationale*: Missing large-scale geometry; PDF integrates directly.

- **Revise Part IV: Observer Cone**  
  *Add*: Cone angle modulated by S (angular displacement = d_M α S), explaining "dark" as unseen cone portions.  
  *Rationale*: Ties to PDF's "darkness equals angular displacement" (p7).

- **Changelog**: v0.6.0 - Added cosmology projections; linked cone to S/dark.

## 06-ufrf-integration-summary.md (Integration Summary)
### Proposed Updates
- **Add Section: 3.5 Dark Matter/Energy Integration**  
  **New Content**: Summarize PDF: Dark as projections (mass ratios, w(z) oscillations); S from 13/12 geometry.**  
  *Rationale*: Missing cosmology in summary; PDF provides unified view.

- **Revise Key Ratios**: Add S derivations (e.g., S=-ln(13/12)/d_M).  
  *Rationale*: Enhances predictivity.

- **Changelog**: v0.6.0 - Integrated dark projections; refined S.

## 07-ufrf-cross-domain-validation.md (Cross-Domain Validation)
### Proposed Updates
- **Add Domain 5: Cosmology**

  *Rationale*: Completes cross-domain.

- **Changelog**: v0.6.0 - Added cosmology validation from PDF.

## 08-ufrf-predictions-tests.md (Predictions and Tests)
### Proposed Updates

  **New Content**: w(z) periodicity Δz≈1/13; Hubble offsets 13/12; test via DES/Pantheon+ (PDF §3/6).**  
  *Rationale*: Missing cosmic tests; PDF provides falsifiables.

- **Revise Success Criteria**: Include geometric S for predictivity.  
  *Rationale*: Addresses tunability.

- **Changelog**: v0.6.0 - Added cosmology predictions; emphasized geometric S.

## 09-ufrf-objection-handling.md (Objection Handling)
### Proposed Updates
- **Add Objection 7: Tunability in Projection Parameters**  
  **New Content**: Response: S derivable geometrically (e.g., ln(13/12) for Hubble, as in dark matter PDF); predictive examples match without adjustment.**  
  *Rationale*: Directly addresses conversation issue; PDF shows non-post-hoc S.

- **Changelog**: v0.6.0 - Added tunability objection with geometric resolution.

## 10-ufrf-fourier-connection.md (Fourier Connection)
### Proposed Updates
- **Add Section: Part XI: Fourier Projections in Cosmology**  
  **New Content**: Fourier spectra of cosmic data (e.g., rotation curves) show 13-periodicity (PDF §2.3); dark oscillations as interference.**  
  *Rationale*: Extends to missing domain.
