# Unified Fractal Resonance Framework (UFRF): Axioms, Derivations, and Cross‑Domain Evidence

**Abstract.** We present a five‑axiom geometric framework in which EM vortices generate
quantum, gravitational, and nuclear phenomena. We derive a 13‑position cycle, a REST
(E=B) enhancement of √φ, a projection law for observer‑relative measurements, a near‑REST
PPN form for gravity, a shell‑gap pattern in nuclear data, and a physical explanation for
Fourier analysis. We report validations and make falsifiable predictions (14 MeV shell gap,
network transition near 137, 28 K anomaly).

## 1. Axioms and Derived Necessities
(Summary of the five axioms; derivation of cycle, REST, projection.)

## 2. Derivations
2.1 EM emergence and REST  
2.2 PPN near REST and Δp² scaling (a/b = 1/φ²)  
2.3 Nuclear half‑integer gaps  
2.4 Quantum emergence (Schrödinger near REST)  
2.5 Fourier E⊥B correspondence

## 3. Validations
- Nuclear shell pattern; β‑function baseline; PPN (γ,β) within bounds.
- Domain‑wise statistics; artifact logs and manifests.

## 4. Predictions and Falsifiers
- 14.0 MeV gap, 137 transition, 28 K anomaly; technique‑dependent projections.

## 5. Methods & Reproducibility
- Code layout, scripts, environment, artifact manifests.

## 6. Discussion & Alternatives
- Competing explanations; ablation tests; registered analysis plans.

## 7. Conclusion
- Unified, falsifiable, reproducible framework with concrete next experiments.
