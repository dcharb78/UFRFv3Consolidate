# UFRFv3 Development Plan

## 2025-10-27 â€” Repo sync and make public (kickoff)
- Objective: Sync local changes to `origin/main` and set repository visibility to public.
- Context: Multiple untracked Markdown files detected in workspace root. Need to commit and push.
- Plan:
  1. Review git remotes and current branch status.
  2. Stage and commit all new/modified files with a clear message.
  3. Push to `origin/main`.
  4. Update remote visibility to public (via hosting provider API/CLI if available).
- Notes: Keep GPU-related configs unchanged; focus is repository hygiene and visibility.
