# UFRFv3 Development Plan

## 2025-10-27 — Repo sync and make public (kickoff)
- Objective: Sync local changes to `origin/main` and set repository visibility to public.
- Context: Multiple untracked Markdown files detected in workspace root. Need to commit and push.
- Plan:
  1. Review git remotes and current branch status.
  2. Stage and commit all new/modified files with a clear message.
  3. Push to `origin/main`.
  4. Update remote visibility to public (via hosting provider API/CLI if available).
- Notes: Keep GPU-related configs unchanged; focus is repository hygiene and visibility.

## 2025-10-27 — Repo sync and make public (completion)
- Actions:
  - Committed 17 new docs files and `development_plan.md`.
  - Pushed to `origin/main` (https://github.com/dcharb78/UFRFv3Consolidate).
  - Changed repo visibility to PUBLIC via GitHub CLI.
- Outcome: Sync complete; repository is now public.
- Next: None for this task.

## 2025-10-27 — Documentation integration (kickoff)
- Objective: Review, update, and integrate all docs; fix references and navigation.
- Scope:
  - Inventory existing `.md` files (01–16 series, validation index, IMVP/ProofKit docs).
  - Create root README with table of contents and links.
  - Update `16-ufrf-validation-package-index.md` references to real repo paths.
  - Add cross-links between 01–16 docs (Next/Prev) as feasible.
- Plan:
  1) Inventory and spot broken refs; 2) Create README; 3) Update validation index; 4) Commit & push; 5) Log completion.
- Notes: Keep structure stable; do not change theory content, only navigation/links.

## 2025-10-27 — Documentation integration (completion)
- Actions:
  - Added root `README.md` with ToC linking 01–16 and key packs.
  - Updated `16-ufrf-validation-package-index.md` to link to in-repo files; removed stale references.
  - Appended Prev/Next footer navigation across 01–16 docs.
- Outcome: Navigation and index are consistent and discoverable.
- Next: Review deeper link targets in IMVP/ProofKit subtrees in a later pass.
