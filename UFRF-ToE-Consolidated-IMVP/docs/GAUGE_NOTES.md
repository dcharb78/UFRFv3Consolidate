# Gauge Notes (Maxwell → SU(2)/SU(3))

- **U(1)**: F = dA; Bianchi dF = 0. Maxwell kinematics tested by discrete Bianchi residuals.
- **SU(2)/SU(3)**: field strength F^a_{μν} with structure constants f^{abc}. We verify:
  - SU(2) vacuum invariance under small gauge rotation (F=0 stays F=0).
  - SU(3) antisymmetry of f^{abc}.
  - **Gauge-invariance gate**: traced Wilson loops W(L) unchanged under site-dependent SU(3) transforms (numeric ≪ 1e−10).
  - **REST abelianization**: commutator/derivative ratio ⟨|g[A,A]|⟩/⟨|∂A|⟩ drops as ε→0.
