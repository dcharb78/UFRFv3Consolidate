# PPN Dynamics: Recursive Resonance Model (Conceptual, Testable)

We model γ(t), β(t) as emergent from a recursive observer–observed loop:
- State has (Φ, I1, Δp), observer has (α, d_M).
- At each step, beats among cycles (Earth/Jupiter/Saturn) perturb phases,
  projection updates the observed potential, and γ, β are extracted.

Outputs:
- time series γ(t), β(t)
- time averages ⟨γ⟩, ⟨β⟩ and oscillation amplitudes
- convergence metrics
